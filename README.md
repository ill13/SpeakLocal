# SpeakLocal
A TTS [text-to-speech] extension for oobabooga text WebUI

```silero_tts``` is great, but it seems to have a word limit, so I made **SpeakLocal**. 

This extension re-encodes the locally generated .WAV file to an .MP3 and pre-pends a media player to the text output field.

- 100% offline
- No AI
- Low CPU
- Low network bandwidth usage
- No word limit

### How to use:

Fire up a command prompt | shell:

```cd PATH_TO_text-generation-webui/extensions```

Now clone this repo:

```git clone https://github.com/ill13/SpeakLocal```

Finally enable the extension in the *session* tab
